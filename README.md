# DoggyDates
Remake of a doggy play dates app that was started in school as a project.  Plan to fully complete this and release for all the doggos to find loving friends. 


How to build this android app.
	Learn:
		Android layout with XML
		Kotlin vs Java
		Intent (Switch between screens so far)
	Need to learn:
		Database to allow login and profiles
		Location
		Maps activity
		Messaging
	Think about:
		Show online for messaging? <= can make people uncomfortable
		Probably not show that someone has looked into your profile <= has lead to people filling insecure.
		Maps <= Show local dog parks?
		Group Things? <= Could allow users to create groups of some sort to have people sign up as if it was a meetUps thing

Read the 'How To and Reminders' word doc to see how to implement some features this app has. Created for my own future reference, hope it's helpful.
